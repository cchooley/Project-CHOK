## Project Description
Bettership partners with schools and institutions to list internship opportunities in the Denver Metro Area. We provide an improved matching experience for students seeking internships that will more effectively locate relevant and exciting opportunities. Bettership also creates mutual accountability by requiring students to log internship hours and provide feedback on their experience for institutions and future students alike.

## Problem statement
High School internships are often a requirement for graduation.  The problem is that it is difficult for students to find internships that are of applicable interest and also often hard for them to develop professional skills from the experience.  

## How will your project solve this problem?
It will provide an interface for students to look at a list of school approved internships and filter them by area of interest.  The student can then “apply” to the position to practice what the actual job process would be like.  Once the student is “accepted” they will receive details on their internship as well as log their hours and feedback on the system. 

## Map the user experience
- Student logins or signs up on the landing page.
- First time user is then prompted to create a student profile which features their interests.
- Those interest are then used as a filter for internship matching. 
- Student can then see a list of internships that match their interests and “apply” to the one they want.
- Once they apply their profile is then updated with their active internship.
- All future logins by the student  brings them directly to their profile page where they can select their active internship and enter their hours and provide feedback on their experience with that internship.
